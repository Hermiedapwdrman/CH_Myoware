# CH_Myoware
A repository to share example code and experiments using Arduino and the Myoware EMG sensor.  In short, the goal of this repo is to provide a starting point for someone to build their own test system; and possibly to share future improvements and innovations.

## NOTE for OTs:
If you want me to do a small tutorial on how you guys can use git and github to collaborate let me know.  Github is great for allowing multiple people to futz around with code, documentation, etc. at the same time and then combine them in a sane manner.


## Goals
- Provide well documented code for a new user to be able to configure, load and use a simple version of the project.
- Include links and tutorial information for:
    - Shopping lists and resources for purchasing hardware, cabling, enclosures, custom boards and manufacturing equipment.
    - Installing software and programming an arduino capable board.
    - Pictures and explanations for assembling hardware.
    - Examples, test data, an rules of thumbs for configuring myo sensor.
    - Method for contributing (either via git/github or other)?
    - Alternative more advanced implementations?

### Wishlist: Features and behaviors we might want in a device?
- Latching behavior: One activation to enable, stay enabled until second activation, then disable.
- More easily accessible, or less finicky, potentiometer gain adjustment?
- Battery operation?
- Cord free operation, I.E. Wi-fi or Bluetooth?
- Combination hookah and coffemaker?
